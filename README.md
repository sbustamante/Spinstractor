Scripts to extract and analyse spin evolution of black holes in Arepo snapshots

Files
-----

   - BH_Physics.py: master module with different functions and classes to work with simulated BHs as well as semi-analytical recipies for BH evolution.
   - BH_Indexing.py: script to detect unique BH IDs in simulations, regardless their redshift.
   - BH_Spin_Histories.py: script to extract BH spin, mass accretion and angular momentum histories from simulation for the BHs listed as unique.
